Steps

1. Install typescript
    npm install -g typescript
    - This command install the compiler that then compiles a .ts file
    to javascript.
    compile hello_world.ts
2. Create a using-ts.ts file and copy contents of js-only.js to it.
    touch using-ts.ts
3. Delete js-only.js to resolve the errors reported for ln1 - ln3 in using-ts.ts
4. Remove type checking code in using-ts.ts ln13 - ln23 and uncomment function, add.
5. Add typecasting example
    e.g document.getElementById("num1")! as HTMLInputElement
6. Add argument types in function, add.
    - When you hover over ln13 i.e function add(num1, num2)...
    arguments, you observe the arguments are described as
    (parameter) num1:any.
    - This indicaates typescript is not aware of the datatype.
    - To address this, add the dataype as shown below.
    function add(num1: number, num2: number)...
7. With the argument data type set, input1.value, results in an error.
    - To view the error message, run
    tsc using-ts.ts
    - The command above compile the typescript code and results in the error below.
    Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'
8. Change the invokation of function, add, as follows
    (add(+input1.value, +input2.value))
   to resolve the type mismatch error in step (7).
9. Delete the file using-ts.js generated in step (7).
    rm -f using-ts.js
    - When compiled, using-ts.ts, creates a vanilla javascript file
    with the aid of the features defined in steps (1) to (8) to ensure
    the production of less error-prone code.
10. Change index.html change
    <script src="js-only.js" defer></script> to <script src="using-ts.js" defer></script> 
    since the browser can't run using-ts.ts as it doesn't understandd typescript.
